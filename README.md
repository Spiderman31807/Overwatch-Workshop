# Overwatch Workshop
Where i keep backups of all my Overwatch Workshop Projects

To use any of the snippets stored here just copy them, go onto Overwatch, enter a custom game. 
And paste it into the orange clipbard option in the top right of the settings tab

All the files use the .oww file type, this is because the language i use while editing Overwatch Workshop
Scripts with Vs-Code is "overwacthworkshop" from a extention in VS-Code and its assigned file type is .oww
